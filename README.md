# ZedMini Description
The Zed Mini Distance Estimation Project centers around using the ZED Mini to create an Augmented Reality (AR) project within the HTC Vive.
The goal of this project is to measure how vast distances are percieved in AR.

# Experimental Procedure
Currently, the experiment sits at 30 trials. There are 6 objects and 5 distances for each object. The subject will estimate the percieved
distance and height of the object in the environment for each trial.
